In this programming assignment, the objective is to create a C program capable of performing scientific operations on matrices. The program generates two random 2D arrays, A and
B, with specified dimensions, and supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and solving linear systems of equations. The input format requires specifying matrix
dimensions and the desired operation, with an optional parameter for printing the matrices and
results. The implementation involves three main files: math matrix.c, functions.h, and functions.c, with functions like addMatrices() and solveLinearSystem() handling the various operations. Testing includes verifying correctness and identifying potential issues like segmentation
faults, with debugging tools used to pinpoint errors
